[SmileGuy]|Greetings player!|||76
[SmileGuy]|Welcome to the SuperBlah12|Game app program thing!||76
[SmileGuy]|Today, you will be asked a series of questions,|make a couple of choices, and some other third|thing.|114
[SmileGuy]|Then, we will display an interesting|(maybe) story based on all of that.||76
[SmileGuy]|first would you like to hear a short story|on how this engine was made?||380
CHOICE
1|2
1. Yes|2. No||38
Hear my story?
14|27|28|30
true
[SmileGuy]|Alright then!|Here's the gist of it!||76
[SmileGuy]|There is a game called: |Phoenix Wright|Ace Attorney|532
[SmileGuy]|It is a very fun game where you|solve a murder mystery.||76
[SmileGuy]|It is displayed to you in a very|linear comic book story format.||76
[SmileGuy]|You spend a good portion of the|game reading the story as it unfolds.||76
[SmileGuy]|Every once and a while you are given|an oportunity to make a desicion|answer a question.|76
[SmileGuy]|The story will change around that decision.|||76
[SmileGuy]|This genre of game is called a|"visual novel"|which is a very apt name.|76
[SmileGuy]|Remove the decision making|parts and you'll have a graphic novel.||114
[SmileGuy]|Ace Attorney has a couple of other|features that make it unique...||76
[SmileGuy]|However, due to time constraints|and ability constraints...||152
[SmileGuy]|These unique features could not|be implemented.||152
[SmileGuy]|Oh well!|||380
[SmileGuy]|Thanks for humoring me!|I'll remember that!||380
[SmileGuy]|Oh. Okay...|||152
[SmileGuy]|I didn't want to tell you anyway.|||342
[SmileGuy]|I'm gonna remember this.|You just wait.||342
[SmileGuy]|SO!|||380
[SmileGuy]|That was a choice right there!|||76
[SmileGuy]|See...|||76
[SmileGuy]|While I could have written an interesting|story that fully implemented|this engine,|114
[SmileGuy]|I've instead opted to type this|Mundane Allegory Pretending to be Story||152
[SmileGuy]|Yes. That is shortened to MAPS|Which, coincidentaly is also something else.||76
[SmileGuy]|Here comes a question.|||76
[SmileGuy]|If you get it wrong something|bad will happen.||342
[SmileGuy]|Here it comes:|||76
QUESTION
2|1|3
1. Helpful Google Product|2. SPAM Backwards|3. EVIL LETTERS!|114
What am I refrencing?
46|47|48|51|52|56
false
[SmileGuy]|Yup. SPAM is often said to stand for:|Stuff Posing As Meat||304
[SmileGuy]|Which is similar to my silly description.|||304
[SmileGuy]|Nope. Not referring to Google Maps.|||152
[SmileGuy]|Sorry. But you just lost some HP.|||152

[ROBOT]|WRONG ANSWER BETA ACTIVE|INITIATING TIME LOOP||228
[SmileGuy]|So that was a question.|||76
[SmileGuy]|They can hurt you if you chose to do so.|||76
[SmileGuy]|You can also make them harmless.|||76
[SmileGuy]|You still need to answer|them correctly tho.||114
QUESTION
1|2|3

[SmileGuy]|That makes like,|two of three features.||76
[SmileGuy]|Or is it four?|||114
[SmileGuy]|Three?|||114
[SmileGuy]|No. It's two.|||114
[SmileGuy]|Time to implement the second|half of the two features!||380
CHOICETREE
83|85|86|100
[SmileGuy]|You wanted to listen to|my story about how I made this.||76
[SmileGuy]|Had you said no,|I would have held you captive|and forced you to listen to it now.|76
[SmileGuy]|But you said yes, thus I won't.|||380
[SmileGuy]|You didn't want to hear my story.|||342
[SmileGuy]|NOW YOU WILL BE FORCED TO LISTEN.|||342
[SmileGuy]|Alright then!|Here's the gist of it!||76

[SmileGuy]|Oh well!|||380
[SmileGuy]|Tada!|||380
[SmileGuy]|Told you I'd remember!|||76
[SmileGuy]|Oh! there's another feature!|||266
[SmileGuy]|Hit "S", hit enter, hit "Q",|hit enter and then reopen the program!||76
[SmileGuy]|Tada!|You've come back right|where you've started.|76
[SmileGuy]|I even remember what|choice you've made still!||380
CHOICETREE
109|110|111|112

[SmileGuy]|Nope.|||152
[SmileGuy]|See!|||76
[SmileGuy]|Magic.|||76
[SmileGuy]|Unfortunately, I can only act upon|the last choice that you made.||114
[SmileGuy]|If another choice is made|I'll be incapable of reacting|to the previous one.|114
[SmileGuy]|Now to show you an implementation|of randomnessity.||76
[SmileGuy]|First I'll have ROBOT|generate a random choice.||76
[ROBOT]|BEEP BOOP||INITIATING RANDOMNESS|228

[SmileGuy]|Well, that was random.|||114
[SmileGuy]|I'm sure that could be used in an interesting way.|||76
[SmileGuy]|That was not one of them.|||152
[SmileGuy]|I'd also like to note|I've completely forgotten|the first choice|152
[SmileGuy]|I don't know if you listened or not at this point.|||152
[SmileGuy]|Alright.|||76
[SmileGuy]|Thats actually three features isn't it?|||76
[SmileGuy]|Neato.|||76
[SmileGuy]|Welp...|||152
[SmileGuy]|I'll admit the engine isn't all|sunshine and rainbows.||152
[SmileGuy]|A short list of bugs:|||152
[SmileGuy]|Cannot save in a Question/Choice|||38
[SmileGuy]|Cannoit save in a dialogue tree|of any kind.||38
[SmileGuy]|ASCII art is a pin to make.||Not a bug, just an observation.|38
[SmileGuy]|Many thanks to|http://www.glassgiant.com/ascii/||38
[SmileGuy]|Syntax of data files|difficult and confusing.||38
[SmileGuy]|The list goes on.|||38
[SmileGuy]|Sigh...|||38
[SmileGuy]|That's about it really.|||114
[SmileGuy]|Very simple ASCII art|visual novel engine.||76
