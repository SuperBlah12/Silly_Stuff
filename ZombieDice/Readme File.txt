Welcome to Zombie Dice!

Zombie dice is a very simple game where you play as a zombie on the hunt for brains!

To start the game, first open the "Zombie Dice.jar" file. It will ask for your name, enter it here. Next it will ask you to input the number representing the risk taking abilities of the computers. Safe playing computers will bank more brains than Risk taking computers. 

After you have selected your difficulty, the game screen will open. It you versus 4 computer opponents! To play, simply click "roll". You will be presented with which dice you rolled.

There are three colors of dice and 3 different symbols on each die.

The "Brain" symbol is your goal. You want as many of these as possible.
The "Explosion" symbol represents you being shot. Three strikes and you're out. 
The "Foot steps" symbol represents a runner. You will have to roll all your runners again if you choose to continue.

The three colors are green, yellow, and red. Each color has a higher probability of landing on a shot and a lower probability of landing on brains. Green are the best dice while red are the riskiest.

Each turn will involve you rolling three dice, adding the number of brains you've rolled to your pool. If you haven't managed to get 3 shots, you have the option to pass or keep rolling. If you pass, all the brains in the pool get added to your score. You can keep rolling until you pass or get three shots.

Play continues with each player repeating this process until one player reached 13 points. When a player reached 13 points, the final round begins. Every player gets one more chance to roll the dice before a winner is announced. Whomever collected the most brains at the end of the final round is the winner! You may then click roll to play again with the same settings. Good Luck!
